# Thinking out loud
*Ordered*

---

Components that aren't full screens should be previewed with appropriate backgrounds

---

• Let's get the initial list prototyped.
• Only pull in the minimum data required and rely on previews

---

Let's ensure all previews include dark mode.
	- Text inherits Color.primary by default but the background colour needs to be explicitly set before it'll show.

---

*Project setup*
- Swiftlint autocorrect makes the warn-fix cycle quicker
- Previews
	- Should check light / dark by default

---

App names are always a challenge, here I'm going to forego caring too much but as it's superhero-focused initial ideas:
• Supes, capes, spandex

I'll go with Spandex for the tongue-in-cheek value.
