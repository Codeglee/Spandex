# Thinking out loud
*Ordered*

---

Let's add some grouping and animation using MatchedGeometryEffect to animate group selection.
MatchedGeometryEffect is usually used for image > modal / fullscreen effects but this is another good use.

---

Let's add a comprehensive search that checks more than just name, in thi dataset there's name, aliases, alter egos, full name, place of birth and alignment that could help you find "That human baddie with a 'Bom' in it.   

---

Components that aren't full screens should be previewed with appropriate backgrounds

---

• Let's get the initial list prototyped.
• Only pull in the minimum data required and rely on previews

---

Let's ensure all previews include dark mode.
	- Text inherits Color.primary by default but the background colour needs to be explicitly set before it'll show.

---

*Project setup*
- Swiftlint autocorrect makes the warn-fix cycle quicker
- Previews
	- Should check light / dark by default

---

App names are always a challenge, here I'm going to forego caring too much but as it's superhero-focused initial ideas:
• Supes, capes, spandex

I'll go with Spandex for the tongue-in-cheek value.
